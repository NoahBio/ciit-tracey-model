# CIIT-Tracey Computational Model

Computational validation of Tracey's Three-Step Model of therapy using Contemporary Integrative Interpersonal Theory (CIIT) and Reinforcement Learning.

## Research Questions

1. **Model-Free (RQ1)**: Does the Three-Step Model emerge naturally from a client-therapist interaction based in CIIT?
2. **Model-Based (RQ2)**: Does Tracey's strategy work optimally given certain client dynamics?

## Technical Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.12
- **RL Framework**: Tianshou 1.x
- **Algorithms**: PPO+LSTM (model-free), MBPO (model-based)
- **Environment**: Custom Gymnasium environment
